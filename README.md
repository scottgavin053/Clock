For the clock application, the goal was to be able to keep track of time and display it. It was also able to add an hour, a minute, or a second to the time. For this project, the implementation of looping output of the time once every second then clearing the screen was important to mimic the digital clocks we see all the time. The in the main function, the code could have been enhanced with a swtitch case instead of if else statements. Using the time functions was a bit challenging since I had never used the tools before, but some reading on documentation and Stack Overflow helped me solve all the problems. Using the sleep function was a handy skill to learn that can be used in future projects to offset how output is displayed. By creating the two functions and keeping the main function short, this can be altered easier.
